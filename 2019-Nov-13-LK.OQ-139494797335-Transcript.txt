Operator 


Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Luckin Coffee's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Today's 
conference is being recorded. 


At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Zima at ICR for opening remarks and introductions. Please go ahead, sir. 


Bill Zima 
ICR, LLC - Partner 


Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Luckin Coffee announced their third quarter 2019 financial results earlier today. 
The press release is now available on the company's IR website at investor.luckincoffee.com. 


Today, you'll hear from Charles Lu, Co-Founder and Chairman of Luckin Coffee; Jenny Qian, Co-Founder and CEO; and Reinout Schakel, 
CFO and CSO of the company. We will be referring to a slide presentation on today's call, which can be found at the link in the press 
release we issued this morning and on the company's IR website, investor.luckincoffee.com. 


During this call, the company will be making some forward-looking statements regarding future events and results. These statements

Charles Lu 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - Co-Founder & Chairman 


Thank you, Bill. Good evening and good morning everyone. Thank you for your support for Luckin Coffee. 


We are very pleased with our results in the third quarter: We exceed the high end of our guidance range, achieved a strong store level 
profit margin of 12.5% and outperformed across all other key metrics. These results are not surprising to us. It just follows a clear trend. 
Reinout will share the detail with you later. 


During the quarter, sales from the coffee continued to maintain very strong growth. I believe Luckin Coffee will reach its goal to become 
the largest coffee player in China by the end of this year. For those who spend time in China, you can see that Luckin Coffee is already 
part of the daily life in China. Everywhere you go, either large city in Beijing, Shanghai or emerging cities like Chengdu, Tianjin, you will

NOVEMBER 13, 2019 / 1:00PM GMT, Q3 2019 Luckin Coffee Inc Earnings CallNOVEMBER 13, 2019 / 1:00PM GMT, Q3 2019 Luckin Coffee Inc Earnings Call
see our eye-catching blue cups in the CBD areas, universities and many other places. China's coffee market is still under-penetrated, and 
we believe Luckin is helping to drive the rapid growth of the coffee market in China. 


At the same time, we continue to offer more products during the quarter. We launched Luckin Tea products, which has been a great 
success. We also started selling cups and other merchandise products. We also entered into a joint venture agreement with LDC to sell 
NFC juice. As a result, we experienced strong incremental demand, and increase in revenue and higher customer retention rate. 


We also strategically launched Luckin Tea as an independent brand and developed our new retail -- new retailer partnership model. In 
addition, we are engaged in ongoing discussion with a potential strategic business partners to set up joint ventures in the markets 
outside of China by leveraging our technology-driven new retailer model and their local resources. 


I have been often asked whether we are doing too much and too fast. I would say, no. In fact, this is a natural evolution of our business 
model. Since our inception, Luckin's growth has always been beyond everyone's expectations. This is because our business model is 
entirely built on a technology, completely different from a traditional retailer. With our fully technology-driven new retail partnership 
model, we believe we can rapidly expand with limited capital expenditures, while maintaining high quality and high efficiency, at the 
same time, enhance our profitability. 


Now Jenny will provide a brief, brief of the business. Jenny, please go ahead. 


Jenny Qian 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - Co-Founder & CEO 


[Interpreted] During this quarter, we outperformed all operational and financial metrics. Among which, product revenue was CNY 1.493 
billion, an increase of 558% year-over-year. Store level had a profit margin of [12.5%]. Other metrics all met or exceeded our 
expectations. 


Now turning to Page 4. I would like to remind you that this quarter, the growth of product revenue is greater than the growth of the 
number of items sold. The growth of items sold is greater than the growth of transacting customers, and the growth of transacting 
customers is greater than the growth of stores. That shows that we are not just grow quickly, but also be able to improve efficiency and 
profitability at the same time. It also shows that the growth of the revenue is not only due to the growth of stores. 


Please turn to Page 5. Branding is important to our business. Under our strategy, we will continue to significantly invest in branding from 
the second quarter 2019 to the second quarter 2020. As a result, during this period, sales and marketing fees will be relatively high. But 
starting the third quarter of 2020, this cost will return to normal. It should be noted that our discounts and subsidies are already 
reflected in our net revenue, so our marketing expenses are mainly for advertising and marketing campaigns. In addition, marketing fees 
for this quarter were higher than forecast, mainly due to the launch of Luckin Tea stores and partnership model. Next quarter, marketing 
costs will be lower than this quarter. 


Now please turn to Page 6. Last quarter, we successfully launched Luckin Tea products. The sales of Luckin Tea has increased eight 
times in the past 5 months. The per cup economics of Luckin Tea is similar to that of coffee. We provide to customers the consistent value 
proposition of high quality, high affordability and high convenience. Our competitive advantages in tea industry are strong brand, huge 
customer base, large store network, established supply chain and a fully technology-driven operational system. Luckin Tea has helped us 
to improve customer retention rate and store throughput. 


Turning to Page 7. China's tea market has huge potentials. Last quarter, we separated Luckin Tea as an independent brand. Luckin 
Coffee store and the Luckin Tea store have the following differences: First, Coffee store has more coffee SKU and a relatively limited tea 
SKU, while tea store has more tea SKU with fewer coffee choices from only one coffee machine. The second, Coffee store mainly covers 
the first- and second-tier cities, while Tea store will cover the whole country, including fourth- and fifth-tier cities. The third, Coffee store 
is mainly self-operated, while Tea store will operate mainly under partnership model. 


Despite of above differences, the APP of Luckin Tea and that of Luckin Coffee will connect to each other. The operational systems for 2 
brands are based on same technology. The rollout of Luckin Tea stores will help us cover more areas and serve more customers as well

as help us educate customers of coffee consumption in lower-tier cities. 


Please turning to Page 8. Last quarter, we strategically launched the retail partnership model. Relying on our technology-driven new 
retail model, we can effectively control the quality of services and operation process. Our partners are responsible for rent, renovation, 
staff employment and daily operation, and Luckin is responsible for customer acquisition as one free cup for each new customer, 
technology system, supply chain and products. We use a tiered revenue-sharing model, which means the partners do not need to pay 
upfront franchise fee and Luckin will only start sharing the revenue when they reach certain level. 


We believe that our partnership model will benefit the partners to reduce their investment risk, simplify operation and acquire good 
operating income through our strong products, branding and customer base. At the same time, the operational partnership model also 
allows us to develop in asset-light approach, to cover more areas and to serve more customers without heavy CapEx and cash burn as 
well as to drive revenue and profitability. 


It's worth noting that last quarter's revenues did not include any revenue from the retail partnership model since our first Luckin Tea 
store just opened in October. Furthermore, our fourth quarter guidance will not include any revenue from partnership model. We will add 
forecast when the model is relatively mature. 


On Page 9. In addition to the successful launch of Luckin Tea, we also launched lot of merchandise products such as cups. Besides, we 
signed a joint venture agreement with Louis Dreyfus to produce Luckin Juice in the future. Recently, we launched another popular snack, 
Luckin nuts. 


The revenue from non-coffee products increased from the 31% of 2018 to 45% in the third quarter this year. We believe that with more 
and more products offered, we could not only achieve higher customer retention rate, but also improve the store level profitability. 


Please turn to the Page 10. Our growth strategy focus on 2 sides: On one hand, with more customers and increasing purchase frequency, 
lower down our procurement cost. On the other hand, with more stores and diversified products, we can bring more convenience to the 
customers and drive their consumption frequency. 


Luckin is on the way to realize our mission: To become part of everyone's everyday life, starting with coffee. 


Reinout Schakel 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - CFO & CSO 


Thank you. Thanks, Jenny. Thanks, Charles. Hi. Good morning, and good evening, everyone on the call. I will briefly discuss our financial 
performance during the quarter, which we believe was very, very strong. 


If we move to Page 12. The graphs on Slide 12 illustrates our strong momentum across all aspects of our business. I'd like to specifically 
highlight the 24% sequential growth in our store growth versus the higher sequential growth in transacting customers as well as 
monthly items sold. 


We remain on track to open 4,500 stores by year-end. And as Jenny mentioned, growth is not coming just from store openings, but also a 
significant improvement in store efficiency. 


Moving to Slide 12 (sic) [Slide 13], you can see the significant progress we've made on profitability during the quarter. We reached a store 
level margin of 12.5% and saw a month-over-month improvement in the store level profit during the quarter. We also significantly 
reduced our non-GAAP net loss margin, despite what we expect to be peak investments in sales and marketing during the quarter. The 
material improvement in profitability is the result of a very clear trend of strong growth of product revenue, increased store efficiency and 
further benefits of scale. 


On Slide 14. First, I will discuss our product revenue growth. If you look at Slide 14, product revenue was above the high end of our range 
and grew more than 70% sequentially. Illustrative of the improved store efficiency, you can see that the average product revenue grew 
even faster during the quarter.

NOVEMBER 13, 2019 / 1:00PM GMT, Q3 2019 Luckin Coffee Inc Earnings CallNOVEMBER 13, 2019 / 1:00PM GMT, Q3 2019 Luckin Coffee Inc Earnings Call
In terms of key underlying drivers. First, a very strong increase in the number of monthly transacting customers to 9.3 million, a 51% 
quarter-over-quarter increase. This was the result of successfully acquiring close to 8 million new customers during the quarter, a 
notable increase compared to last quarter, and a further increase in the retention rate of our existing customers, partly driven by the 
success of Luckin Tea products. 


Second, the average monthly items per transacting customer during the quarter increased to 4.7, an increase of 6% 
quarter-over-quarter, partly driven by introduction of new products. 


Third, the net selling price per item, which is calculated by dividing net product revenue by all items transacted, and as such, adjusted for 
free products as well as promotions and coupons, was CNY 11.2 for the quarter, an increase of 7% quarter-over-quarter. It is worth noting 
that the net selling price per item increased sequentially despite the buy 10 get 10 free promotion we offered when we announced the 
nationwide launch of the Luckin Tea products, which we did in July. 


Moving to Slide 15 and 16. As a result of our high growth and significant improvement in efficiency, you can see a very clear trend in the 
improvement of our cost structure. This provides us with a lot of visibility in our profitability trend, and we are, therefore, very confident 
that we can reach our company-level breakeven point by the third quarter of 2020. 


If we look at our per cup costs on Slide 16, you see a very similar trend. You can see that we continue to make significant progress in 
reducing our per cup costs, and we already reached below CNY 10 in Q3 from CNY 11.1 in the second quarter and CNY 16.4 in the last 
quarter -- in the third quarter of last year. The reduction in our per cup costs is driven by a decrease of fixed cost per cup as we materially 
increase store throughput. As you can see on the bottom of the page, the number of items sold per store per day materially increased to 
444 during the quarter from 345 in the second quarter and 285 in the third quarter last year. 


In terms of delivery, you can see on Slide 17 that the percentage of delivery organically declined to 12.8% during the quarter. As many of 
you know, the growth in our pickup store development naturally reduces delivery orders as a percentage of our total sales. As a result of 
lower delivery percentage, net delivery subsidy per item further decreased to CNY 0.5 per item during the quarter compared to CNY 2.3 
during the same quarter last year. 


If we move to Slide 18. On the left-hand side, you can see that new customer acquisition costs has modestly increased during the quarter 
compared to last quarter. This is driven by an increase in strategic investments in branding, offset by a material increase in new 
transacting customers. As discussed earlier, we believe that the company reached its peak level of brand expenses during the quarter 
and expect to gradually reach normalized levels by Q3 2020. 


At the same time, you can see from the chart on the right that the transaction value per customer per month, which is based on listing 
price, for each cohort continues its upward trajectory as each customer cohort matures. This is a testament to our ability to gradually 
increase retention rate as well as the number of items purchased per transacting customers as that customer matures. It is worth noting 
that over the last 2 quarters, these metrics continue to increase despite the fact that we've seen a notable increase in the average selling 
price per item. 


Lastly, on Slide 19, I want to briefly discuss our strong balance sheet. As you can see, we have over CNY 5.5 billion of available cash as of 
September 30, 2019. I want to highlight an important point. Our negative cash flow from operations has significantly reduced over the 
quarter to CNY 123 million from CNY 375 million last quarter and CNY 720 million during the third quarter last year. This is mainly driven 
by a reduction of net loss as we gradually approach our breakeven point as well as a favorable working capital profile. We remain, 
therefore, very well capitalized to execute our current business plan. 


This brings us to the end of our formal presentation. In terms of guidance for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2019, the company 
expects net revenue from products to be between CNY 2.1 billion and CNY 2.2 billion. This forecast excludes any revenue generated from 
stores operated under the new launched retail partnership model. This forecast reflects the company's current and preliminary views, 
which are subject to change.

And this completes our prepared remarks. 


QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 


Operator 


(Operator Instructions) We have the first question from the line of Tony Wang from Credit Suisse. 


Tony Wang 
Credit Suisse - Analyst 


Great, thanks. Good Evening everyone, and congratulations on the great results. So, my first question is about the gross margin. So for 
this quarter, why the unit cost of raw material for drink products remain flat quarter-over-quarter? Because my understanding is that the 
cost of the tea products should be higher than coffee, and we have seen a very strong incremental growth from tea products this quarter. 
So this is my first question. 


The second question is, could you talk about the trend of the key operating metrics into the fourth quarter, especially the ASP, as we are 
seeing increasing promotion intensity by you and other competitors? And also the growth outlook for the Luckin Tea products in Q4 given 
the seasonality. 


The third question is about the new retail partner model for Luckin Tea that you have been testing. So could you talk about the progress 
so far? And how long will take, you know, for you to give us some more details? And also whether this model will be replicated to the 
Luckin Coffee store in the future. So that's all my questions, and I will translate myself. (foreign language) 


Reinout Schakel 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - CFO & CSO 


Tony, thanks a lot for your questions, and I'll try and address maybe the first two, and then Charles and Jenny will supplement and sort of 
address your third question as well. 


I think your first question is in relation to kind of the per cup costs and sort of what we're seeing, particularly also around the raw material 
costs. So I guess, taking a step back, I think, first of all, per cup costs really has been trending very favorably. We've seen that as a result 
of increased volumes. We see that sort of particularly, the fixed costs, have been further decreasing as a per item cost, which I think is 
something that we had anticipated and also expect to see going forward. 


When it comes to your raw material costs, I mean, in general, as Jenny mentioned, the sort of cost of material for tea and coffee is not 
that dissimilar. I think tea, yes, is probably going to be slightly higher than that for coffee. But ultimately, I think we've been able to 
obviously also increase the efficiency we have in our supply chain. And also, we think that we can ultimately bring down that raw material 
costs a little bit further. Some of the initiatives that we're doing, including joint ventures with Louis Dreyfus and some others as well, is 
also partly driven by further reducing the cost of raw materials. The main improvement from the per cup costs historically and going 
forward is obviously going to be through increased store efficiency and more items per store per day. 


Now on your second question in relation to the ASP, we've seen another healthy growth of ASP quarter-over-quarter. On the one hand, 
that is because in terms of the number of new customers that we attract or the number of free cups that we give as a percentage of total 
transacting customers, obviously, continues to reduce, because we've been increasing the number of transacting customers. So that has 
a less dilutive impact on sort of your ASP. At the same time, also, we continue to increase the number of people that are already paying 
the price that we want them to pay. So it's a trend that we have seen in Q2. We obviously see it in Q3. 


In terms of your questions, yes, we do expect that trend to continue, in line with what we have been communicating on before. So over 
time, the sort of the long-term price that we're looking for is, obviously, that sort of CNY 16 to CNY 17, and we gradually will kind of move 
towards that price point over time.

NOVEMBER 13, 2019 / 1:00PM GMT, Q3 2019 Luckin Coffee Inc Earnings CallNOVEMBER 13, 2019 / 1:00PM GMT, Q3 2019 Luckin Coffee Inc Earnings Call
Charles Lu 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - Co-Founder & Chairman 


[Interpreted] So overall, the feedback on the launch of the new retail model is very positive. We have so far received close to 2,000 
deposits already. And we have identified that some of these new joiners have already located a suitable site for their shop opening and 
also some are under renovation. In October, we actually have seen that quite a few of them has already started to launch the store. 


Overall, we actually see that there is very strong desire to join our new partnership model. However, because of the short historical 
history, we are still trying our best to optimize their operation. So we believe that we can only provide a more insightful guidance next 
quarter, because as of now, we do not have too much visibility on the results of the model. 


So we have already replicated the new partnership model to some of our coffee scenarios. For example, in some hospitals, whereas we 
are not able to go in, we are actually licensing to our partners to do that. But we will still maintain our own separate self-operating model 
target store opening target. And we believe that these new replication of the new model on the coffee business will be an incremental 
upside of the business. 


Operator 


(Operator Instructions) We have the next question from Vincent Yu from Needham & Company. 


Vincent Yu 
Needham & Company - Analyst 


Thank you management and congrats on a great quarter. I have few questions. One is on the marketing expenses. So will there be any 
incremental marketing expenses to support rollout of Luckin Tea store? Like do we have any local sales and promotion campaign that we 
need to share the expense? 


Second question about the repurchase, customer repurchase rates in higher-tier cities and lower-tier cities. And the third question is 
trying to understand your views on the lockup period expiration. (foreign language) 


Reinout Schakel 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - CFO & CSO 


Thanks, Vincent. I'll address your first and your second question, and then Charles will go through the third question. 


So in terms of marketing expenses, just a few things. One is, obviously, in the quarter that we had now, as we mentioned, so the 
marketing expenses were a bit higher because we also launched tea. I think the benefit that we have obviously, is that there's an awful lot 
of synergies between sort of Luckin Coffee and Luckin Tea also in terms of branding and branding budget. Yes, there will be some 
additional expenses for Luckin Tea specifically, but they are already incorporated in sort of the guidance that we've given around to the 
trend that we expect around marketing expenses. 


Your second question around sort of the repurchase rate or the retention rate of kind of the difference between lower and higher tiers. I'll 
generalize the response here. I think when you look at lower-tier versus higher-tier cities, there's a few things that you can see: One, in 
terms of retention rate, very, very similar trend. There's no notable difference between retention rate in sort of the lower-tier cities versus 
higher-tier cities. What we do see is that sort of volumes in higher-tier cities are typically slightly higher than in lower-tier cities. But at 
the same time, you'll see that the cost of labor, the cost of rent will be lower in lower-tier cities. So if you actually look at your per cup 
costs or sort of your store level profitability versus lower-tier cities and higher-tier cities, actually very, very similar. 


Last question around lockup, I'll give to Charles. 


Charles Lu 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - Co-Founder & Chairman 


[Interpreted] I understand that this is a very heavily worried topic, but I would like to give my views here. First of all, the company 
[during](corrected by company after the call) lockup is still in a very high growth rate of our business as evidenced by our Q3 results. All 
the metrics are still showing significant growth. We believe that our profitability will continue to improve, and there remains significant 
upside to our share price. We think most of our pre-IPO shareholders think the same. 


Second, management team owns more than 50%. We have very strong belief in long-term potential and have no intention to sell.

Third, our pre-IPO investors are unlike other companies, just invested and relatively new in their cycles, so they don't have any pressure to 
sell at this point. 


If you look at our shareholder base, you can see that we have a very good long-term shareholder base, which is quite unique among the 
Chinese ADRs, and they are all very positive in our long-term business performance. 


Operator 


We have the next question from the line of Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc. 


Eric Gonzalez 
KeyBanc Capital Markets - Analyst 


Thank you and congrats on a great quarter, and thanks for those comments on the lockup. 


So I just have a question about your profitability this quarter. 12.5% restaurant margin is arguably better than several publicly traded 
restaurant companies. So I was just wondering, how does this make you feel about reaching overall profitability in the third quarter of 
2020. Does this increase the odds that you can be profitable sooner? 


And then maybe secondarily, can you speak to the growth of the core coffee business? Obviously, you have some pretty strong metrics 
and across items sold and ASP. But maybe if you could just isolate the coffee business and how that performed versus your expectations. 
Thanks. 


Interpreter 


I will translate the question. (foreign language) 


Reinout Schakel 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - CFO & CSO 


Eric, thanks for dialing in. Thanks for your question. 


So I guess, the first question, just in terms of profitability. And obviously, I think the store level profit that we had in Q3 was very, very 
positive. As we explained kind of the trend that we're seeing is obviously not just kind of store growth, but you see growth of number of 
customers, number of items, the ASP, and this is also a trend that we expect to continue to develop going forward. So we certainly think 
that, obviously, the store level profitability will increase going forward. 


We also said in terms of kind of the cost base, and we look at the SG&A, the biggest component is sales and marketing. And I think we've 
got a very, very clear strategy around sort of our branding strategy and also the costs related to branding and how we're going to bring 
that down by Q3. 


So I think from where we are today, we can say, look, very high confidence that we'll reach that breakeven point by Q3 2020. Certainly, 
we expect that store level profitability to further increase over time. 


Now on your question on coffee, and thanks for that question. I think one of the points that we certainly want to bring across in this call is 
that coffee is doing very, very well. Whichever way you look at it, we've been in China for now close to 2 years, we're very close to selling 
the same or more cups per day than our largest competitor. As Charles mentioned, we think we can be the largest coffee player by the 
end of this year. 


And when you look at metrics, and for example, if you look at number of coffee items that we sell per store per day, quarter-over-quarter, 
10% to 15% growth, which we think is very, very strong. If you look at it year-over-year, and particularly when you also adjust for the free 
cups that you give because obviously, last year, we gave a lot more free cups because that was effectively our initial introduction to 
customers. If you look at the paid cups of coffee, year-over-year, we saw growth very, very close to 50% in terms of the number of items 
per store per day. So I think coffee has been doing very, very well.

NOVEMBER 13, 2019 / 1:00PM GMT, Q3 2019 Luckin Coffee Inc Earnings CallNOVEMBER 13, 2019 / 1:00PM GMT, Q3 2019 Luckin Coffee Inc Earnings Call
What's been very positive? In addition to that, this quarter is that, obviously, we've had a lot of incremental demand from also tea, coffee 
and tea, very little cannibalization. We've seen that the tea demand effectively has been almost incremental, which also have been 
driving the number of items per store per day. And that's also brought us, obviously all the benefits around efficiency, retention rate and 
ultimately, profitability. Thank you.

Hello, everyone. Thanks Charles, Jenny, Reinout for the presentation and congratulations for the very good results. I have 2 questions 
here. The first one is, how do you balance or how do you think about the store productivity versus store openings, especially in the fourth 
quarter, which is a big quarter for store opening. I can see that store productivity has been growing very good in the third quarter. How do 
you think about the trend in the fourth quarter? And can it still grow further? 


The second question, it's about the product mix. We see non-coffee already account for 45% in the third quarter. I know we had a target 
of 50-50 by year-end. How do we think about it now? And how do we think about it over the longer term? Do we think non-coffee will 
continue to rise to 60%, 70% of our mix? Or how do you think about that? Let me translate in Chinese. (foreign language) 


Charles Lu 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - Co-Founder & Chairman 


[Interpreted] First of all, I would like to explain our business logic. We are very different from the traditional model, whereas they will 
open the store first and then they will look for demand. However, we have located demand first by our delivery business, whereas we are 
able to spot the demand growth by either the increase of frequency and also the customer -- number of customers. Therefore, we are 
only to open the store to meet the needs. 


We have maintained a very good balance of demand and opening. We have already have a very sophisticated analysis of the customer 
behavior by setting our locations closer to them and also locating higher frequency and also more customer products. We are able to 
identify the need, and we believe that the number of stores to be opened are needed by these increased customer demand. 


So we actually do not have a target on the non-coffee mix. However, we believe that it will continue to grow. But first of all, I would like to 
clarify that this is not because of our core coffee business, the growth to slow down. Rather, it is because of the non-coffee growth trend 
is growing at a higher speed. And eventually, we believe that it will increase to exceed 50%, but we currently have no visibility on that. It 
will overall be based on customer needs and also profitability target.

Good Evening Everyone. Congratulations, and a good performance of the third quarter. I have 3 questions. And the first is, what is the 
percentage of Luckin Tea products out of total freshly brewed products. And as the weather gets colder in the fourth quarter, do you 
expect a decrease of demand for the Luckin Tea products and will it negatively impact the items sold per store per day in the fourth 
quarter. 


And my second question is also about the update of Luckin Tea stores. So I would like to know for a mature Luckin Tea store, what is your 
expected number of items sold per store per day, and the normalized profit margin for Luckin Tea store compared with Luckin Coffee 
stores. 


And my third question is, can you share with us your cooperation with Americana? And do you have any intention to enter into more areas 
outside of China. 


So I will translate myself. (foreign language)

NOVEMBER 13, 2019 / 1:00PM GMT, Q3 2019 Luckin Coffee Inc Earnings CallNOVEMBER 13, 2019 / 1:00PM GMT, Q3 2019 Luckin Coffee Inc Earnings Call
Charles Lu 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - Co-Founder & Chairman 


[Interpreted] So to answer your question, Luckin Tea, the sales is about 20% of the freshly brewed drinks in quarter 3. And we agree with 
you that in Q3 and Q4(corrected by company after the call), because of the cold weather, the demand for the Luckin Tea products may 
decrease. However, for our hot coffee drinks, we expect an increase on that. But overall, we have a quite optimistic view on the increase of 
the tea sales. 


So we actually have launched some self-operated Luckin Tea stores. We actually see that the profitability over the overall performance 
are actually quite similar to our coffee shops. For our partnership model operating the Luckin Tea brand, we actually see some of them 
have good performance and some less good performance. However, we believe that we should be able to provide you more visibility 
estimation next quarter as we are still fairly -- we are still observing the results of these new model. 


So to answer your question, we are actually not just in the discussion with Americana to expand our business. We are also talking to 
other business partner in other regions. So the answer is yes, we will expand to other more regions as well. But the overall target is that 
we have to maintain an asset-light strategy of expansion, which means that we will control or limit our investment and also cash burn 
rate. We actually want to expand by leveraging our IT technology and also our business know-how. So the 3 items that we will focus on is 
that we need to ensure that these expansions will protect our service quality, cash flow and also to ensure our profitability.

Hi Charles. Hi Jenny. Hi Reinout. Thank you for taking my questions, and congratulations on another strong quarter. I just have 3 
questions. My first question is on the product range. We have been very successful in launching new products, such as Luckin Tea. I just 
wanted to ask if management has any plans to introduce, on large-scale, non-drink products into our core SKU. So that's my first 
question. 


The second question is on store efficiency. Jenny mentioned that revenue growth is not just coming from new stores. I'm just wondering if 
we could share the same-store sales growth during quarter 3. 


My last question is on the customer type, are we seeing any differences in customer types between Luckin Tea and Luckin Coffee? For 
example, Luckin Tea consumer is younger, more skewed towards female? Is there any difference between income just on the behavior or 
the customer type? 


Let me translate myself. (foreign language) 


Jenny Qian 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - Co-Founder & CEO 


[Interpreted] In terms of the non-drink products, of course, other than the coffee and tea products we already launched, so we want to 
serve and integrate with our customers' daily life. So recently, we launched the nuts. And in the future, we already signed agreement with 
Louis Dreyfus to produce the Luckin Juice in the future. 


Reinout Schakel 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - CFO & CSO 


Billy, the second question on sort of the like-for-like. And I think the reason -- like-for-like for us is not sort of a metric that is maybe the 
most relevant because we don't like looking at sort of a series of stores. We're looking at sort of the entire platform. Obviously, one, 
because we don't have that many mature stores as you would define, sort of more than 13 months open. Secondly, also the way we use 
the sort of the delivery platform and how we allocate sort of products to the various stores, which is based on location, rather than on sort 
of the sort of the age of the store. 


Now what we have included in this quarter in terms of disclosure is the average product revenue per store per quarter, which effectively, 
again, is looking at it from the entire platform. You can see, obviously, that your per quarter revenues -- your revenue per store in the 
quarter has increased significantly. If you look at Page 14, it's grown by nearly sort of 80% year-over-year, which obviously indicated that

sort of the efficiency of store level is a function of, A), the increase in the number of items per store per day; and secondly, also, an 
increase in sort of the average price that we see each and every sort of quarter going up. So I think there, you can get an indication on sort 
of the trend that we're seeing and sort of the strong growth we see in the average revenue per store. 


Jenny Qian 
Luckin Coffee Inc. - Co-Founder & CEO 


[Interpreted] So for our current stores, we still focus on the CBD areas. So what we observed from the data, our customers for Luckin Tea 
and Luckin Coffee are similar. 


Charles Lu

[Interpreted] Thank you all for your support, and welcome to visit any of our stores in the major cities, such as Beijing, et cetera. If you're 
interested, please feel free to contact our IR. We will take you to the stores that you would like to see and show you our products and our
